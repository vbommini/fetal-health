This project is aimed at developing a classification model to predict the health status of fetuses based on various fetal health parameters. The dataset used for this task contains features extracted from cardiotocogram (CTG) exams, which are commonly used to monitor fetal health during pregnancy. In this report, we present the implementation details and performance evaluation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and AdaBoost classifier for fetal health classification.
